   - Visit http://localhost:5173
   - Click "Register"
   - Fill form with valid data
   - Submit and verify redirected to login
   - Login with credentials
   - Verify dashboard loads with metrics

2. **File Upload**
   - Navigate to "Upload"
   - Select a test file
   - Add description
   - Click upload
   - Verify file appears in "My documents"

3. **File Details**

   - View file details
   - Check blockchain info section
   - Click "Register on-chain"
   - Verify transaction hash displayed

4. **Verification**
   - Navigate to "Verify"
   - Upload file or enter hash
   - Verify result displays correctly
   - Try "Copy report" and "Print" buttons

5. **Admin Panel**
   - Login as admin

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing (Simple)

```bash
# Install Apache Bench
apt-get install apache2-utils

# Test API endpoint (100 requests, 10 concurrent)
ab -n 100 -c 10 http://localhost:8000/api/health

# Test with authentication
TOKEN="your-token"
ab -n 100 -c 10 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/files
```

### Load Testing (Advanced with Locust)

```bash
# Install Locust
pip install locust

# Create locustfile.py with test scenarios
# Run: locust -f locustfile.py --host=http://localhost:8000
```

---

## Security Testing

### 1. Rate Limiting

```bash
# Try rapid registration (should limit after 5)
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/register \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"email\":\"user$i@example.com\",\"password\":\"Pass123\"}"
done

# Should return 429 Too Many Requests after 5 requests
```

### 2. Input Validation

```bash
# Test weak password
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"short"}'

# Expected: 422 Unprocessable Entity (validation error)

# Test invalid email
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"invalid-email","password":"Pass123"}'

# Expected: 422 Unprocessable Entity
```

### 3. CORS Testing

```bash
# Test CORS from different origin
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/health \
  -H "Origin: http://attacker.com" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET"

# Check CORS headers in response
# Should be restricted to configured origins
```

### 4. SQL Injection

```bash
# Try SQL injection in search
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/files?q='; DROP TABLE users; --" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Should safely escape and return no results
# (SQLAlchemy ORM prevents this)
```

### 5. Authentication

```bash
# Test without token
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/files

# Expected: 403 Forbidden

# Test with invalid token
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/files \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid-token"

# Expected: 401 Unauthorized
```

## Database Testing

### Connection Test

```bash
docker compose exec db psql -U app -d file_registry -c "SELECT * FROM users;"
```

### Backup Test

```bash
# Create backup
docker compose exec db pg_dump -U app file_registry > backup.sql

# Verify backup
wc -l backup.sql  # Should have many lines

# Test restore (to new DB)
psql -U app -d test_db < backup.sql
```

---

## Blockchain Testing

### Contract Interaction

```bash
# Check if contract is deployed
docker compose logs blockchain | grep "Contract deployed"

# Verify contract address file exists
docker compose exec backend cat /shared/contract_address.txt
```

### Transaction Verification

```bash
# Get transaction receipt from blockchain
curl -X POST http://localhost:8545 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "eth_getTransactionReceipt",
    "params": ["0xTXN_HASH"],
    "id": 1
  }'
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Fail

```bash
# Check service health
docker compose ps

# View logs
docker compose logs -f backend
docker compose logs -f db
docker compose logs -f blockchain

# Restart services
docker compose down
docker compose up --build
```

### Database Issues

```bash
# Reset database (WARNING: deletes data)
docker compose down
docker volume rm blockchain-diplom_db_data
docker compose up --build
docker compose exec backend alembic upgrade head
docker compose exec backend python -m app.scripts.create_admin
```

### Rate Limiting in Tests

```bash
# Clear rate limiting cache (if using in-memory)
# Restart backend service
docker compose restart backend
```
